# Simple Screen Saver Disabler
Simple Screen Saver Disabler is a small cross-platform Java application that can disable the activation of an adminstrator set screensaver activation.

Use Case: QA Automation UI desktops that stops working because the operating system kicks off a screen saver. 
`java -jar ssd.jar` can be run from the terminal, it is not detectable by usual scanning programs. So run it at your own risk.
